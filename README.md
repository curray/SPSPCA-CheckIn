# SPSPCA-CheckIn
Local html file for local animal rescue wellness checkins, adoption finalization check ins, and intake. A quicker way for people to check in themselves as they come into the building and keep arrivals in order. 

Has a 'start' screen and 3 buttons, for wellness, finalization, and intake check in. The first 2 buttons are anchor links to the following sections. If names have been 'bulk added' to the list, they will show here. Someone needing to check in can click on the rescue's name of their dog, and it will add them to the appropriate list. This will help keep arrivals in order to be helped. 

The third button will open up a modal. We do not have new dog's names on the list for intake, so this gives the person a chance to name the dog or even put their own name to be called to get in line on the wellness check in order. Number of intakes varies per week, so having modal for information is helpful. 

Scrolling down past the finaliation check in, there is a bulk add button. This is how animal names will be created as 'buttons' and added to the appropriate list (Wellness or Adoption Finalization.) It is a modal that has 2 inputs for adding names to wellness and adding names to finalization. 

**Please note, there are still some kinks being worked out and features being added. Currently working on a way to remove added names (in case of cancelation, misspelling, etc.) and also seeing the full list in the bulk add modal before adding to the main page. This will come with a way to delete names as well before they are added. Also learning how to store the information on the site unless 'Reset' button is clicked, so that accidental refreshes of the page do not remove any information.
